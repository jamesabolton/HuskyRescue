			<p>The founding members of Texas Husky Rescue came from Adopt-A-Husky of Dallas (AHDI), and started TXHR in May of 2009. They wanted to create a rescue group where leadership was active in all aspects of the organization. The mission of the new group would be to rescue, rehabilitate, and find qualified loving homes for neglected, abused, and unwanted huskies throughout Texas and beyond; and to educate the public about responsible pet ownership and the special qualities of the Siberian Husky Breed.</p>
			<p>TXHR was started with no money or supplies, but in their first year, through grants such as Save Our Siberians - Siberspace Rescue Fund, donors, and adoption fees the group was able to save 31 huskies, which exceeded everyone’s expectations. The first boarding facility used by the group was in Argyle, with individual indoor/outdoor dog runs, but it was not an ideal location for recently rescued huskies. Several other boarding facilities were used before they began to work with Doggie’s Wonderland in 2011.</p>
			<p>To give each rescued husky a new start, they are all given a new name when they come into the group. At first the huskies were all named after Texas cities and icons, but after a while that became more difficult, and dogs are now named alphabetically, or based on a theme for huskies rescued as groups or pairs.</p>
			<p>TXHR’s first rescued husky was Addison, a pregnant black and white girl pulled from Breckenridge, TX. While in her foster home, Addison had her nine puppies on May 12th, 2009. Unfortunately, all of the puppies passed away a week later due to an undetected tick disease they contracted from their mother, who nearly died as well. This was a devastating start to everyone in the group. Ultimately, Addison’s fosters adopted her in the fall of 2009.</p>
			<p>The second husky rescued was Beaumont, aka Beau, who also came from Breckenridge, TX on April 9th, 2009. Scott Todd was looking for a husky in the latter part of 2009 when he met Beau and fell in love. Scott has been active in the group ever since.</p>
			<p>In September 2009 the group was asked to take in at least one husky from a seizure of eighteen in Collin County. These huskies were in horrible shape, as they had either been kept chained up outside or isolated in horse stalls their entire lives. Cate and Leisha went to the shelter to help bathe them, and agreed to take more than one.  Eventually several other rescues backed out of helping, and TXHR took in six huskies at once: Miles, Owen (kept in a horse stall), Paige, Nixon, Cherokee and Shelby! Leisha dug up old contacts and started begging to get foster homes for these mistreated huskies. Two people Leisha contacted were Mary & James Bolton, who had adopted a husky from AHDI (Leisha’s first adoption application!).  Mary & James agreed to foster Shelby, who found her forever home about 4 months later. They also fostered Owen for a short while, before she was moved to Nelson Hodges because of her extreme fear and anxiety.  Nelson had previously fostered a husky named Houston for TXHR, and ended up fostering Paige, Miles, and Owen until they were each adopted in 2010. Steve Hensley, who has been involved with rescue for over two decades, fostered and eventually adopted Cherokee a year after he was saved. Pictures of these huskies can be viewed on Facebook here and here.</p>
			<p>In 2010 the board of directors had a shake up as two of the founding board members left the group. At the same time, James & Mary were becoming more involved in many aspects of the group, so the board asked them to join on.</p>
			<p>In 2011 TXHR was contacted about a mama husky, Caroline, with several puppies that needed to be rescued. We were fortunate to be put in contact with a great donor and foster, Denise Camp, who took care of Caroline and her puppies. Denise has remained a part of TXHR ever since. She has overseen the care of over 70 huskies and funded the majority of their medical and boarding costs, many of which have been severe medical cases.</p>
			<p>To date TXHR has saved over 880 huskies, including purebreds, mixed breeds, severe medical cases, owner seizures, behavior cases, and more. TXHR is committed to saving huskies regardless of their past.</p>
